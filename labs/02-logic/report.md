## Pre-Lab preparation

1.The truth table for 2-bit Identity comparator (B equals A), and two Magnitude comparators (B is greater than A, B is less than A).

 | **Dec.equivalent** | **B[1:0]** | **A[1:0]** | **B>A** | **B=A** | **B<A** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
   | 0 | 00 | 00 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
   | 1 | 00 | 01 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 2 | 00 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 3 | 00 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 4 | 01 | 00 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
   | 5 | 01 | 01 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
   | 6 | 01 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 7 | 01 | 11 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
   | 8 | 10 | 00 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
   | 9 | 10 | 01 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
   | 10 | 10 | 10 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
   | 11 | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 1 |

## 2-bit comparator

1. Karnaugh maps for other two functions of 2-bit comparator:

   Greater than:

   Less than:

2. Equations of simplified SoP (Sum of the Products) form of the "greater than" function and simplified PoS (Product of the Sums) form of the "less than" function.

## 4-bit comparator

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`testbench.vhd`) with at least one assert (use BCD codes of your student ID digits as input combinations). Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   Last two digits of my student ID: **xxxx??**

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the beginning of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        -- First test case
        s_b <= "BCD_OF_YOUR_SECOND_LAST_ID_DIGIT"; -- Such as "0101" if ID = xxxx56
        s_a <= "BCD_OF_YOUR_LAST_ID_DIGIT";        -- Such as "0110" if ID = xxxx56
        wait for 100 ns;
        -- Expected output
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = 'WRITE_CORRECT_VALUE_HERE') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = 'WRITE_CORRECT_VALUE_HERE') and
                (s_B_less_A    = 'WRITE_CORRECT_VALUE_HERE'))
        -- If false, then report an error
        report "Input combination COMPLETE_THIS_TEXT FAILED" severity error;

        -- Report a note at the end of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
    end process p_stimulus;
```
