## Pre-Lab preparation

1.The truth table for 2-bit Identity comparator (B equals A), and two Magnitude comparators (B is greater than A, B is less than A).

 | **Dec.equivalent** | **B[1:0]** | **A[1:0]** | **B>A** | **B=A** | **B<A** |
   | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

2. Equations of simplified SoP (Sum of the Products) form of the "greater than" function and simplified PoS (Product of the Sums) form of the "less than" function.

## 4-bit comparator

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`testbench.vhd`) with at least one assert (use BCD codes of your student ID digits as input combinations). Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   Last two digits of my student ID: **xxxx??**

```vhdl
     p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the beginning of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started";
        
         -- Firsth test case ...
         --29 => last two digits of my id - a = 0010, b = 1001
        s_b <= "1001"; s_a <= "0010"; wait for 100 ns;
        -- ... and its expected outputs
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = '1') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = '0') and
                (s_B_less_A    = '0'))
        -- If true, then do not report anything
        -- If false, then report the following error
        report "Input combination b=0, a=0 FAILED" severity error;

         -- Second test case ...
        s_b <= "0001"; s_a <= "0001"; wait for 100 ns;
        -- ... and its expected outputs
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = '0') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = '1') and
                (s_B_less_A    = '0'))
        -- If true, then do not report anything
        -- If false, then report the following error
        report "Input combination b=0001, a=0001 FAILED" severity error;

        -- Thirth test case ...
        s_b <= "0001"; s_a <= "0000"; wait for 100 ns;
        -- ... and its expected outputs
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = '1') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = '0') and
                (s_B_less_A    = '0'))
        -- If true, then do not report anything
        -- If false, then report the following error
        report "Input combination b=0001, a=0000 FAILED" severity error;
        
        -- Fourth test case ...
        s_b <= "0000"; s_a <= "0001"; wait for 100 ns;
        -- ... and its expected outputs
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = '0') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = '0') and
                (s_B_less_A    = '1'))
        -- If true, then do not report anything
        -- If false, then report the following error
        report "Input combination b=0000, a=0001 FAILED" severity error;
        
            -- Fifth test case ...
        s_b <= "0001"; s_a <= "0000"; wait for 100 ns;
        -- ... and its expected outputs
        assert ((s_B_greater_A = '0') and
                (s_B_equals_A  = '0') and
                (s_B_less_A    = '0'))
        -- If true, then do not report anything
        -- If false, then report the following error
        report "Input combination b=0001, a=0000 FAILED" severity error;
        
        -- Report a note at the end of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process finished";
        wait; -- Data generation process is suspended forever
    end process p_stimulus;
```
